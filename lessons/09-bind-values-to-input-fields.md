# Bind Values to Input Fields in Vue.js

Use v-model to create 2-way data binding. You can render dynamic options in a select element and bind them to their data. Use v-bind on inputs to use dynamic properties on the Vue instance. Adding modifiers like .lazy, .number and .trim allow us to trim our methods and let Vue take care of things like trimming white space.
